Some artificial life references. 

## Antibiotic gradient resistance

A demonstration of evolution doing gradient descent to antibiotic resistance.

## Evolution of Evolvability

What happens when organisms can evolve their own metaparameters? Gives context to the idea that viruses can control the mutation rate of their own genomes to escape immune system response.

## Evolving Alien Corals

Work by Joel Simons on [coral morphogenesis](https://www.joelsimon.net/corals.html), where a mesh is deformed by a neural network at each vertex, which reads-writes to a reaction-diffusion simulation. Combines a genetic algorithm with novelty search. 

## Self-Organising Textures 

Work by Alexander Mordvintsev on [neural cellular automata](https://znah.net/hexells/) that are trained to reproduce a target image. Goes with the essay [Growing Neural Cellular Automata](https://distill.pub/2020/growing-ca/)

## Open Exploration 

This [paper](https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/6/5/eaay4237) describes a Curiosity Algorithm that can efficiently explore the states a complex chemical system can exhibit.

## Lenia 

Lenia: a [continuous cellular automata](https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.05433) by [Bert Chan](https://twitter.com/BertChakovsky).

## Multiple Neighborhood Cellular Automata

An extension of traditional cellular automata that uses [multiple neighborhoods](https://slackermanz.com/understanding-multiple-neighborhood-cellular-automata/) to generate surprisingly organic patterns.
